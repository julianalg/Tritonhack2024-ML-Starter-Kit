    "## Calculating Correlation Between Variables\n",
    "Now that we have a basic understanding of the data, let's look for correlations between different variables. Since we want to predict the average age, we'll experiment with data from columns 3 to 9 ('length' through 'shell weight'). This will be the X variable and we can set age as the y variable. We use Pearson R to find the correlation coefficient. R values closer to 1 or -1 have a strong correlation, while an R value of 0 has no correlation.\n",
