## Why Python? <a name="python"></a>

## Why Conda? <a name="conda"></a>

Conda is a package management system that keeps packages (NumPy, pandas, etc.) compatible with your projects. It is incredibly useful for people working in data science and machine learning because it allows them to use different versions of the same package across different projects. 

The software you will download, Miniconda, will include Conda, Python, and some functional packages.

## Why Git? <a name="git"></a>

Copy the text circled in red using Ctrl+C. Next, press the Windows key and search for “Command Prompt”. Open it up, and paste the text into the terminal. It should look like this:

Wait until a line pops up right below the last line that, after the name of your current working directory, reads: “del miniconda.exe”. Press Enter, then close the Command Prompt. Next, press the Windows key and search for “Anaconda Prompt”. Once you have found it, open it. It should look like this:

If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You have finished setting up Miniconda on your WIndows device. Although there doesn’t look like much going on here, you can type “help”, then press Enter to discover a list of commands for Conda.
