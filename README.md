# [Tritonhack2024-ML-Starter-Kit](https://tritonhacks.github.io/Tritonhack2024-ML-Starter-Kit/)

In this machine learning project, we will build a regression model to predict any values that you want. In our starter project, we will use crab age data to predict crab age based on given measurements for a species of crab in order for you to understand data science project and starter building your own project.

## Data Sources

Data for this project is collected from [Crab Age Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shalfey/extended-crab-age-prediction). Feel free to explore your own dataset that inspire/excites you!

### IMPORTANT: Downloading the Data

1. Download the csv file from the above link
2. On your local computer, place the csv file in the folder called `data` inside the `Tritonhack2024-ML-Starter-Kit` repository
